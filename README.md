# PySpark-Taxi-Tip-Prediction

The goal of this project is to utilize AWS EMR Cluster and PySpark to model Big Data. 

## Files
To ensure the reproducibility of the project, each file can be run independently. The files are organized as follows:

- `PySpark-EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code of the exploratory data analysis, identifying patterns that are useful for modeling.
- `PySpark-Modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code of the modeling process, including feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data, which contains detailed trip-level data, including pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The dataset is available on the [Open Data on AWS page](https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records-pds/).
